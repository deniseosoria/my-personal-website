        Atleast 5 times I year, I enjoy traveling to either visit family and friends through out the US or the Caribbean

    <p>
        Have been a hairstylist for 12 years. I style womenâ€™s hair for special occasions and weddings. I enjoy helping
        people feel confident and happy through their hair. A good hair day will always remind a woman that she is that
        girl!
